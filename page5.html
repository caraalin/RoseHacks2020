            <div class="title1"> F A Q</div>
            <br>
            <div class="QA"><b>Question 1: What is a carbon footprint?</b>
            <br><p>Historically, one’s Carbon Footprint is defined as the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by that particular individual. Currently in the United States, the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions are human activities such as burning fossil fuels for transportation. Driving more fuel-efficient and eco-friendly cars is one way to help to reduce one’s carbon footprint and offset the impact on climate change.</p></div>
            <br>
            <div class="QA"><b>Question 2: Why should I care about fuel-efficiency, reliability, and eco-friendliness?</b>
            <br><p>Burning fuel causes the most damage to our earth’s ozone layer, bringing about harsh climate changes and global warming. Driving a fuel-efficient or entirely eco-friendly car could bring down smog and pollution levels by 50%, and is also better for your wallet in the long run!</p></div>
            <br>
            <div class="QA"><b>Question 3: What is the difference between reliability and safety?</b>
            <br><p>When a car is reliable, it only needs its scheduled maintenance check ups where the oil is changed, tires are rotated, brakes are checked, and tire alignment checked if needed. When a car is unreliable, the owner has to keep repeatedly take in their car for unexpected and unplanned issues. A higher safety rating on a car is the best. When a car has a higher safety rating, this means you are less likely to encounter a fatal accident. Some aspects that make safety higher are the latest models, lower center of gravity, heavier weight, extra safety technology and/or equipment, and better crash-test ratings.</p></div>
            <br>
            <div class="QA"><b>Question 4: Why should I care about car insurance?</b>
            <br><p>The main purpose of car insurance is to provide liability protection just in case you get into a car accident. All 50 states legally require car drivers to at least have a minimum liability and property damage coverage, and those who get into accidents and don’t have this insurance are subject to enormous penalties.</p></div>
            <br>
            <div class="QA"><b>Question 5: What is credit score and why does it matter?</b>
            <br><p>A credit score is a statistic based on your past credit history that lenders use to determine how likely you are to pay back a loan or not. It is important to be aware of your credit score, because many first time car buyers will need to take out a car loan, and this is the main determinant of how much that loan will cost.</p></div>
            <br>
            <div class="QA"><b>Question 6: What are different payment plans?</b>
            <br><p>Payment plans generally fall into the two categories of financing and leasing. Most buyers tend to go for financing, in which they take out a loan from a creditor or another trusted outside source, and negotiate the price they will pay for the car as well as how many months it will take to pay off and the monthly APR. Leasing is a better option for those that only plan on holding the car for the short term, as it is cheaper, but you pay to use the car for a limited number of months and miles and return it to the dealership at the end of the lease.</p></div>
